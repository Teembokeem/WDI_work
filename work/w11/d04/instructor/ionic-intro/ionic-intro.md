## Roadmap

- Slide Presentation on _ionic_

- Video by one of _ionic's_ creators, Max Lynch

- Browse _ionic_'s Documentation

- Deployment

## Slide Presentation on _ionic_

For our first look at _ionic_, we'll flip through a brief presentation that's popular for introducing _ionic_.

The presentation is located in the `ionic-presentation` folder. It can be viewed by running a http server such as `live-server`, `http-server`, `server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in terminal from within this folder.

Let's check it out!

That's pretty cool how we can use our mobile app in the browser like a regular web application, but it's not as cool as using it in one of the _device emulators_ as we'll see later!

## Browse _ionic_'s Documentation

[_ionic_'s documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) is phenomenal.

Let's browse through the docs being sure to visit:

- CSS Components
- JavaScript

## Video by _ionic_ Team Member, Max Lynch

Now that we know what _ionic_ is (**an open-source mobile app development framework**)...

the technology stack involved (**Phone SDK, HTML5/JS/CSS, Cordova, Angular & ionic**)...

and understand the use case for _ionic_ (**develop hybrid iOS & Android apps using a single code base**)...

Let's watch an official _ionic_ video hosted by one of _ionic_'s creators, Max Lynch.

The video explains and demonstrates ionic's capabilities in greater detail and will lead us through creating another ionic app (this time using a tabbed UI).

We will stop the video from time-to-time to discuss topics in further detail.

We will watch the video together on the projection screen. For future reference, the link to the video can be found near the top of [_ionic_'s _Getting Started_](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) page.

## Deployment

To make your application available to the world as if it were a 100% native app, you can deploy it on:

- Google Play Store (Android)
- Apple's App Store (iOS)

Both platforms require you to join their developer platform for a fee:

- Google Play Store - One time $25 fee
- Apple's App Store - Annual fee of $99

Deployment is non-trivial and requires answering a bunch of questions and generating extra resources such as screen shots & icons.

In our next lesson, we will be building out a game using ionic. If you'd like a sneak preview, it's deployed on _Play Store_, you can find it by searching for `mastermind jim clark`.
