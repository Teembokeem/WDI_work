##### First and foremost:

### GET SOME REST!

If you want to get a small head start on node, here are a few excellent 
resources:

[The Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#the-art-of-node)
 - An in-depth view of NodeJS. Can be a bit technical, but a good reference to have anyway!

[Understanding Express.js](http://evanhahn.com/understanding-express/) -
 A beginner's view of Express. Helpful to read up on node first!

[Node School](http://nodeschool.io/) - A good place to get small 
tutorials on different technologies. I especially recommend the "Core" 
lessons.

Additionally, you should start practicing your JS over the weekend. Look
to [CodeWars](www.codewars.com/r/b2Ed3Q) for excellent little 
challenges.

Remember, if they seem to hard, select the *8th kyu* filter, and select 
*most popular* - this will give you the easiest challenges on the 
website!
