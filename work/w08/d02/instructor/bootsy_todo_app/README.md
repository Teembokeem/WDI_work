## It's BOOTSY, Baby!

![](http://okp-cdn.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/JBsPhoto.jpg)

Today we'll be building a Todo app all about [Bootsy Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootsy_Collins), The Man Who Put Bass In Yer Face (back left, here seen in the JBs).

As a lousy bass player, I always wondered, how did Bootsy get so dang good at bass?

As a poor dresser, I always wondered, how did Bootsy get so dang good at dressing himself?

As a poor chiller, I alwasy wondered, how did Bootsy chill so dang hard!?

Quickly, I realized I needed an application that would help me become more like Bootsy Collins. Could you build me a todo app that could help me lead a more Bootsy lifestyle?

## Pre-Planning

Let's quickly look at what the final app will resemble.

**Home Page**: No data is being pulled from the DB.

**About Page**: Needs only the amount of todos in the db - should be solved by server-side templating.

**Todos Page**: This page needs a significant amount of data to CRUD our Todo resource. Additionally, if we're planning to handle CRUDing between page-loads, we'll need client-side templates with LoDash.

#### Take 5 minutes to review the code.

Things to note from photos:

- The navbar elements' bottom-border changes when on its corresponding page (**HINT**: Using the custom - written by me - class name `selected`)
- In the todos page, when a Todo is clicked, it moves to the "Baby, I Gottaâ€¦" field.
- Each todo has a bootsy level, from 0-5. The color of the hint corresponds to the level.
  - Bootsy Level 0: No background color, class name `bootsy0`
  - Bootsy Level 1: Blue background, class name `bootsy1`
  - Bootsy Level 2: Green background, class name `bootsy2`
  - Bootsy Level 3: Brown background, class name `bootsy3`
  - Bootsy Level 4: Red background, class name `bootsy4`
  - Bootsy Level 5: Gold background, class name `bootsy5`

## Server-Side Templates v. Client-Side Templates



## Things We GOTTA Know!

Delimiters.

Some stuff about JQuery UI draggables



## Let Us Begin!

We'll be building this app for the remainder of the day. Here's how I expect we'll start:

1. Set up the back-end to ensure we are delivering data.
   - Create a todo model
   - Set up our Todo controller
   - Set up our routes
   - Ensure we can persist and access data using Postman
2. Build our templates
3. Build our scripts to fill said template
   - Set up AJAX calls to gain access to data
   - Attach data to templates
4. Bring it all together and do a bit of styling
   - Use provided css classnames to style page
   - Improve UI by incorporating Drag and Drop with JQuery UI

Today's going to be a busy day, so enjoy your break and then lets get to it.
