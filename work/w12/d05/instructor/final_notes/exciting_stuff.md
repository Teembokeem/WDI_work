## List of Cool Programming Stuff

#### ES2015

Learning all there is to know about the upcoming additions to JS is not only fun and cool, but also a great way to show you're keeping up with the times. Additionally, learning these now will make working in JS easier!

- [All of ES2015 in 350 Bullet Points](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6)
- [Tower of Babel](https://github.com/yosuke-furukawa/tower-of-babel)

#### Code Challenges

Hone your skills! You should do one code challenge every morning - trust me, it'll make your familiarity with JS that much better!
