## Weekend Lab

This weekend, we're giving you options. You can do one or both, but please take this weekend to practice AngularJS.

### [ng-Tic-Tac-Toe](./options/ng-tic_tac_toe.md)

Make another Tic Tac Toe, but this time, with Angular.

### [Portfolio Site](./options/portfolio.md)

Make your portfolio site!

### Can't Decide??

Each of these have benefits, so of course, if you have time, do both.

You'll be able to use your portfolio site immediately out of class and it could be a big help to your job search.

However, you will learn more doing ng-Tic-Tac-Toe. Improving your angularJS skillz will benefit you more in interviews and code-challenges. Additionally, it may give you one more project to add to your personal site.
