## First Project Retrospective

Gather with your groups and perform a retrospective. We will use a 
simplified version of the [Thinking Hats Retro][thinking-hats], where we
collaborate to discuss the course of the project and our own work on it.

The categories are, in order:

### The Prime Directive

**...**

### Process

Working with your stand-up groups from the week, perform the Simplified
Thinking Hats Retro. Each team will need:

- 1 writer with the markers: Black, Green, Red and Blue, and a towelâ€¦
- 1 recorder with a phone and laptop.

Other than these two, *no one on the team should have anything out or 
open.* The retro leader (instructor) will run this process, either 
having the groups share back what they've discovered, or retro as a 
class for one or more of the "hats."

After this, follow the steps:

1.  **White Hat**: go around the group and have each person give at least
    one, and no more than two, emotive statements. They should be framed 
    as answers to the question: 
 
    > What feelings do you have about, or did you have during, the sprint?
 
    Take up to 2 minute per team member (up to ten minutes total) to
    discuss these. Feel free to ask each other why, or when, you felt 
    these emotions. **Use this time to calibrate your own responses**, 
    and to be aware of one another's outlook during the course of the 
    retro.
 
    If any emotions are shared, write them down. If they are positive, use
    Green, if negative use Red, and if neutral use Black.
2.  **Black Hat**: now each group should
