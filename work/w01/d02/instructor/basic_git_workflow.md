# Beginner Git & GitHub Workflow

We are going to start practicing **Git** every day by using it to store 
and share our classwork. We do this in our ***class repo***! The class
repo should live in the folder `~/code/wdi`.

In general, you use **Git** in two different ways:

1.  **Git** is used to save coding projects, aka *codebases* or 
    *code repositories*. The common name in the **Git** world to describe
    what we save is ***repo***. A repo is really just a directory on your
    computer filled with other directories and files! And unlike what you
    might be used to, **Git** doesn't just save a single version of a file
    (your last save), it stores *every save* you have made, or an entire
    ***history*** for your repo. Each save is known as a *snapshot*, or
    ***commit***.
2.  

### Git as Version Control

`git status`
`git add -A`
`git commit -m <somemessage>`

### GitHub as a "Git Remote" Host

`git remote -v`

### Git as Collaboration Tooling



`git pull upstream master`
nano: `Ctrl-X`, `Y`

`git push origin master`
