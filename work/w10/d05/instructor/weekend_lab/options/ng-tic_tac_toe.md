## Building Tic Tac Toe with AngularJS

### Objective

Build another Tic-Tac-Toe game, but this time, using AngularJS!

This is a phenomenal way to practice data-binding and logic in AngularJS.

### Minimum Requirements

##### Three states (routes) for game:

- Splash State
  - Take in the players names
  - Introduce the theme of your game
- Game Board
  - Display an empty tic-tac-toe board when the page is initially displayed.
  - A player can click on the nine cells to make a move.
  - Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`.
  - Once occupied with an `X` or `O`, the cell cannot be played again.
  - Indicate who's turn it is
- Victory/Cat State
  - Indicate Winner, Loser, or Tie.
  - Provide a `Restart Game` button that will clear the contents of the board and send you back to the splash state.

##### Try and use angular animations!

Look up [angular animations](http://www.nganimate.org/) and see if you can
incorporate them into your TTT.
