## First Project Retrospective

Gather with your groups and perform a retrospective. We will use a simplified
version of the Thinking Hats Retro, where we collaborate to discuss the course
of the project and our own work on it.

The categories are, in order:

1. FACTS (Black Hat)
2. GOOD THINGS (Green Hat)
3. BAD THINGS (Red Hat)
4. (RE)SOLUTIONS (Blue Hat)
