For extra practice (and so that you can use it to grow in the future),
tonight we are going to introduce you to NodeSchool! 

NodeSchool are a series of command line-based lessons in JavaScript.
For the beginning of this course we are using JavaScript in the browser,
but by using NodeSchool we can practice using the command line and
while also drilling JavaScript.

There is only one beginning NodeSchool lesson: `javascripting`. The
rest are pretty difficult! But you can return to them any time you want
a challenge. Also, there are [NodeSchool meetups in LA][nodeschool-la]
where you can meet other new devs!

## Setup

**[Go to the NodeSchool website's list of tutorials][nodeschool-tutorials]**.
There you can see the lesson `javascripting`. This is what you can try now!

Create a new directory for NodeSchool lessons in your code directory:

```
$ cd ~/code
$ mkdir nodeschool
$ cd nodeschool
$ pwd
#=> /Users/yourname/code/nodeschool
```

Once there, type `npm install -g javascripting`. Then you begin the
lesson by typing `javascripting`:

```
$ javascripting
```

This begins the lesson. *Read the instructions* and follow them!

**If at any time, you want to _run_ the code**, and not just test if it
is right, you can use `node`, the JavaScript interpreter on the command 
line.

For example, if you created a file `hello_world.js`, and you wanted to 
run it, you would type:

```
$ node hello_world.js
```
