## Step by Step jQuery, AJAX, and Client Side Templating

I know a lot of people are still having trouble with AJAX, client-side
logic with jQuery, and using LoDash templates.

Tonight, I'll be walking through the entire process of setting up Uncle
Derry's Fishin Triumphs, all completed between page loads.

**Remember**: You need to have `mongod` and `nodemon` running for your
back end (`derrys_fishin_api`) as you work on the project.

#### If you can't stay tonight, this will help you:

Please go through the js files in `solution/`. They add each method in 
order:

1. GET the fishes and attach them to the dom
2. POST a new fish
3. DELETE a fish
4. PUT (edit) a fish - this one is mama mia difficult and will require
   a bit of CSS
