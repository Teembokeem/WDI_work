# Ruby Weekend

![Ruby](http://zohararad.github.io/presentations/falling-in-love-with-ruby/presentation/images/ruby.png)

### Things to look at:

- [_Why's (Poignant) Guide_](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf)
  - read at least the first 21 pages
  - keep going if you have time (it's a really good book!)
- Please complete this codeschool [Intro to Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- Look up [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) and fall in love
- Sign up for [CodeWars](www.codewars.com/r/b2Ed3Q) to practice your JavaScript and try out some Ruby challeneges.  For now, I'd recommend sticking to the "8th kyu" katas. If you find these very difficult, filter them by popularity! The most popular 8th kyu challenges are generally the easiest!

# AND GET SOME REST!
