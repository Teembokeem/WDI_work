## Tic-Tac-Toe with jQuery

In this directory, you'll find a version of Phil's tic tac toe from yesterday.

Using what you learned today, please attempt to **translate the vanilla JS into jQuery**!

If everything goes well, you should see the length of your code drop dramatically.

Don't forget to include a jQuery CDN: `https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.0.min.js`

Good Luck!
