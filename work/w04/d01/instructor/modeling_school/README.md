## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a 
handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would 
need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes 
and how they would related to other tables.

Work together to draw out diagrams for one of the apps below. Draw your 
diagrams on the wall, so snap photos of the drawings when you've 
finished for safe keeping.

Consider all different angles in each of these examples. What 
relationships exist? What entities are there? What objects and 
intangible ideas are necessary? How would you organize it?

Remember, for each ERD, to name:

- the tables,
- each table's "schema:" ie, its columns/attributes and their types,
- [the relationships between the tables, and their "cardinality"
  (1:1, 1:n, n:n)][notation]

## Exercise

Pick two of the following, design the tables and relationships, and draw 
their ERD:

1. Library: you are building an app that allows children to borrow books
   from the library. Your app should keep track of who borrowed which 
   books and which books people currently have borrowed.
2. Rental App: you are building an app to facilitate the rental process.
   We have many buildings, each with apartments that are either available
   for rent or occupied. We have tenants that live in our apartment 
   buildings.
3. Budget Airline App: you are building an app to manage bookings for an
   airline. The airline needs to keep track of flights, tickets sold
   on those flights, and the status of the flights and passengers.
4. Doggy Day Care: you are building an app to manage a doggy day care.
   This app needs to track owners and their pets: the owners have
   monthly payments for a set number of visits (10), but must also pay
   for any visits more than that in a given month. The pets need to
   have their vaccinations up-to-date, and any dietary or play
   restrictions imposed (including if they do not get along with any
   other pets).

#### Deliverables

An ERD diagram, using crows foot notation, of whatever app you choose. 
For example:

> Note: this example has "Items" as placeholders for the attributes.
